 * Hunting Party
 *
 * 2-4 Participants get the chance to answer. They can either hunt the bunny or hide or one member can trick the others into going without them.
 * If they hunt, each one gets a 1/8 chance to hurt the bunny (The chance will probably be dynamic later. Same with Bunny health and players may have stat boosts and stuff)
 * They also have a chance to be killed by Bunny. Many can die, many can hurt. If Bunny hits 0 that person gets the kill
